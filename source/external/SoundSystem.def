; This is the definitions file for SoundSystem. By including/excluding
; certain values described below, you can include/exclude features and
; control the behavior. These are build-time settings, so you can turn
; code on and off depending on your specifications.

;-------------------------------
SOUNDSYSTEM_GBC_COMPATIBLE	EQU	1
;
; By default, SoundSystem assumes it is part of a DMG-only ROM. If the
; value at $143 in your ROM is set to DMG/GBC ($80) or GBC ($C0), you
; should set SOUNDSYSTEM_GBC_COMPATIBLE to 1.
;
; Notes:
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_GBC_COMPATIBLE is 0, SoundSystem will not allow you
; to specify a WRAM bank other than 0. See SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK below
; for more information.
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_GBC_COMPATIBLE is 0 or not defined, the value for
; SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK will be ignored.
; - Neither CPU, code size, nor RAM usage is affected by this setting.

;-------------------------------
;SOUNDSYSTEM_LARGE_ROM	EQU	1
;
; By default, SoundSystem assumes it is part of a 'small' ROM. That is,
; 4MBytes (256 banks) or smaller. If the value at $148 is set to
; CART_ROM_8192K ($08), you should set SOUNDSYSTEM_LARGE_ROM to 1 to
; allow you to place your code and/or audio data into banks >=256.
;
; Notes:
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_LARGE_ROM is 0, SoundSystem will not allow you
; to specify a CODE bank other than 0. See SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK below
; for more information.
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_LARGE_ROM is 0 or not defined, the value for
; SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK must be <256.
; - CPU, code size, and RAM usage is slightly more if this is enabled.

;-------------------------------
SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK	EQU	14

; By default, SoundSystem will place its code and data in ROM bank 0.
; If you want to place it in a different bank, set SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK
; to the bank id.
;
; Notes:
; - The value you specify in SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK must be legal when all
; other definitions you have specified in this file are taken into
; consideration.
; - It is up to you to change ROM banks before and after making any
; SoundSystem call. SoundSystem will not do this for you.
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_CODE_BANK is not defined, the code will reside in bank 0.
; - Neither CPU, code size, nor RAM usage is affected by this setting.

;-------------------------------
;SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK	EQU	1

; By default, SoundSystem will place its WRAM variables in WRAM bank 0.
; If you want to place it in a different bank, set SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK
; to the bank id.
;
; Notes:
; - The value you specify in SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK must be legal when all
; other definitions you have specified in this file are taken into
; consideration.
; - You do not need to change WRAM banks before making any SoundSystem call,
; however, it is up to you to change WRAM banks after making any SoundSystem
; call. SoundSystem will not do this for you.
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK is not defined, the variables will reside in
; bank 0.
; - CPU and code size is slightly less if SOUNDSYSTEM_WRAM_BANK is 0.

;-------------------------------
;SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_SFX	EQU	0

; By default, SoundSystem assumes it is part of a game (instead of a demo or
; some other music-only project.) Therefore, sound effects are enabled by
; default. If you only need to play music, setting SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_SFX to
; 0 will remove that code and not try to process any sound effects.
;
; Notes:
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_SFX set to 0, all SFX_ features (see
; SoundSystem.inc) will not be available.
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_SFX is not defined, sound effects will get processed.
; - CPU and code size is slightly less when this is disabled.

;-------------------------------
;SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_VUM	EQU	1

; SoundSystem can provide data that can drive a VU-meter type display. This is
; disabled by default, but access to that data is provided by setting
; SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_VUM to 1.
;
; If enabled, the data (value $0-$F) is in 4 1-byte variables, one per channel:
;     'wVUMeter1' = channel 1
;     'wVUMeter2' = channel 2
;     'wVUMeter3' = channel 3
;     'wVUMeter4' = channel 4
;
; They are contiguous in memory so you can access them as an array if needed.
;
; Notes:
; - If SOUNDSYSTEM_ENABLE_VUM set to 0 or not defined, the 'wVUMeterN' variables
; will not be available.
; - CPU, code size, and RAM usage is slightly more if this is enabled.
