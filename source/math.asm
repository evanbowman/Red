;;; Used for indexing into our world map. The map is 18 blocks wide and 16
;;; blocks tall. We assume here that inputs are less than 16. This code will
;;; not work correctly if you pass a y value greater than 15.
l16Mul18Fast:
;;; c - y value less than 16
;;; result in hl
;;; trashes b
        ld      h, 0
        ld      b, 0

;;; swap (aka left-shift by four for the x16 multiplication)
        ld      a, c
        swap    a
        ld      l, a

;;; Then, add twice, to reach x18
                add     hl, bc
        add     hl, bc
