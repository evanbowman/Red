;;; This function should only be used for loading stuff during scene
;;; transitions, when you don't want to turn off the lcd. High overhead.
;;; Note: do not assume anything about the scanline position after calling this
;;; function. VramSafeMemcpy may likely return during the blank window, but
;;; don't assume anything.
;;; Also note: this is a blocking call, and the cpu will be halted outside of
;;; the vblank window.

;;; de - dest

;;; TODO: technically, we can also speed this up by copying during the hblanks,
